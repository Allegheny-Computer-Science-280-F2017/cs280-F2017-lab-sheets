\section*{Objectives}

To continue to practice the use of GitHub to access the files for a laboratory assignment. Next, you will continue to
practice understanding a Python program's source code, revising a Markdown document, and running a test suite. As in a
previous assignment, you will also interact with a simulated customer, performing the tasks of verification and
validation, giving demonstrations, and finding and fixing defect(s) in the specification and/or source code of a
software application. However, the key focus of this assignment is project management and team work. Using GitHub and
the ``GitHub flow'' model, you will work in an assigned team to specify, design, implement, test, document, and release
the same list generation system from the previous laboratory assignment.

\section*{Suggestions for Success}

\begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}

\item {\bf Use the laboratory computers}. The computers in this laboratory feature specialized software for completing
  this course's laboratory  assignments. If it is necessary for you to work on a different machine, be sure to regularly
  transfer your work to a laboratory machine so that you can check its correctness. If you cannot use a laboratory
  computer and you need help with the configuration of your own laptop, then please carefully explain its setup to the
  systems administrator or the course instructor when you are asking questions.

\item {\bf Follow each step carefully}. Slowly read each sentence in the assignment sheet, making sure that you
  precisely follow each instruction. Take notes about each step that you attempt, recording your questions and ideas and
  the challenges that you faced. If you are stuck, then please tell the course instructor what assignment step you
  recently completed.

\item {\bf Regularly ask and answer questions}. Please log into Slack at the start of a laboratory or practical session
  and then join the appropriate channel. If you have a question about one of the steps in an assignment, then you can
  post it to the designated channel. Or, you can ask a student sitting next to you or talk with course instructor in
  person or through Slack.

\item {\bf Store your files in GitHub}. Starting with this laboratory assignment, you will be responsible for storing
  all of your files (e.g., Python source code and Markdown-based writing) in a Git repository using GitHub Classroom.
  Please verify that you have saved your source code in your Git repository by using \command{git status} to ensure that
  everything is updated. You can see if your assignment submission meets the established correctness requirements by
  using the provided checking tools on your local computer and in checking the commits in GitHub.

\item {\bf Keep all of your files}. Don't delete your programs, output files, and written reports after you submit them
  through GitHub; you will need them again when you study for the quizzes and examinations and work on the other
  laboratory, practical, and final project assignments.

\item {\bf Back up your files regularly}. All of your files are regularly backed-up to the servers in the Department of
  Computer Science and, if you commit your files regularly, stored on GitHub. However, you may want to use a flash
  drive, Google Drive, or your favorite backup method to keep an extra copy of your files on reserve. In the event of
  any type of system failure, you are responsible for ensuring that you have access to a recent backup copy of all your
  files.

\item {\bf Hone your technical writing skills}. Computer science assignments require to you write technical
  documentation and descriptions of your experiences when completing each task. Take extra care to ensure that your
  writing is interesting and both grammatically and technically correct, remembering that computer scientists must
  effectively communicate and collaborate with their team members and the tutors, teaching assistants, and course
  instructor.

\item {\bf Review the Honor Code on the syllabus}. While you may discuss your assignments with others, copying source
  code or writing is a violation of Allegheny College's Honor Code.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Reading Assignment}

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant ``GitHub Guides'', available at
\url{https://guides.github.com/}, that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular,
please make sure that you have read guides such as ``Mastering Markdown'' and ``Documenting Your Projects on GitHub'';
each of them will help you to understand how to use both GitHub and GitHub Classroom. To do well on this assignment, you
should review Chapter 1 of the SETP textbook. You should also read Chapter 2 of SETP, paying particularly close
attention to the stages in the software process models and the descriptions of any verification and validation tasks.
Please see the course instructor if you have questions these reading assignments.

\section*{Accessing the Laboratory Assignment on GitHub}

To access the laboratory assignment, you should go into the \channel{\#announcements} channel in our Slack team and find
the announcement that provides a link for it. Copy this link and paste it into your web browser. Now, you should accept
the laboratory assignment and see that GitHub Classroom created a new GitHub repository for you to access the
assignment's starting materials and to store the completed version of your assignment. Specifically, to access your new
GitHub repository for this assignment, please click the green ``Accept'' button and then click the link that is prefaced
with the label ``Your assignment has been created here''. If you accepted the assignment and correctly followed these
steps, you should have created a GitHub repository with a name like
``Allegheny-Computer-Science-280-Fall-2017/computer-science-280-fall-2017-lab-2-gkapfham''. Unless you provide the
instructor with documentation of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, not accepting the assignment means
that you automatically receive a failing grade for it.

Now you are ready to download the starting materials to your laboratory computer. Click the ``Clone or download'' button
and, after ensuring that you have selected ``Clone with SSH'', please copy this command to your clipboard. To enter into
your course directory you should now type \command{cd cs280F2017}. By typing \command{git clone} in your terminal and then
pasting in the string that you copied from the GitHub site you will download all of the code for this assignment. For
instance, if the course instructor ran the \command{git clone} command in the terminal, it would look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
  git clone git@github.com:/Allegheny-Computer-Science-280-F2017/computer-science-280-fall-2017-lab-2-gkapfham.git
\end{lstlisting}

Now, please study the \reflection{} in the repository. By reading this file you will learn how to run the \mainprogram{}
program and observe that its output is not correct. The \reflection{} will also teach you how to run the provided test
suite for this program and see that it fails. Please make sure that you carefully record your experiences when
completing each of these and other steps and that you understand the purpose, input, and output of each command. Now,
you will need to learn more about the Python programming language so that you can understand the requirements for this
program and ensure that it ultimately works correctly. If you need to modify the program's specification or
implementation, please carefully document your fix, making sure that the program produces the correct output and that
all of the test cases pass. Finally, you should add at least four new test cases that establish a confidence in the
correctness of your implementation.

\section*{Eliciting Requirements from the Customer}

You are responsible for implementing a data generator that should take a list of numbers as input and produce a list of
lists as output. You are given the following specification for it.

\begin{quote}

For an input list of entities, $L$, the data generator must produce, in addition to the input list, all of the lists
that can be obtained by swapping two adjacent items in $L$.

\end{quote}

\noindent
For list $L = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, the customer wants the data generator to output $L'=\{L_0, \ldots, L_6\}$ with

\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep 0in
  \item[] $L_0 = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$
  \item[] $L_1 = \{2, 1, 3, 4\}$
  \item[] $L_2 = \{3, 2, 1, 4\}$
  \item[] $L_3 = \{4, 2, 3, 1\}$
  \item[] $L_3 = \{1, 3, 2, 4\}$
  \item[] $L_4 = \{1, 4, 3, 2\}$
  \item[] $L_6 = \{1, 2, 4, 3\}$
\end{itemize}

The customer knows that the component that you must create will be a part of a larger system that has not yet been
fully implemented. You are responsible for implementing this data generator so that it functions according to the
provided specification. However, please note that the stated requirements may not be entirely correct! It is the job
of your team to interact with the customer to ensure that the system is implemented as desired. Using Markdown, you
should write a requirements document that fully explains the inputs, outputs, and behavior of the data generator.

\section*{Designing the System}

Leveraging the content in the requirements document, you should create a design for your system, also drawing
inspiration from the existing code as a starting point. As you are finalizing the design, you should try to develop
answers to relevant questions such as: How many functions will you use? What will be the relationship between the
functions? What parameters will the functions have? What will be the inputs and outputs of the functions? Is the design
easy to understand? After answering these questions and studying the provided Python code, you should use Markdown to
write a design document with text that explains the organization of the system.

\section*{Implementing the System}

Now, you should take the requirements and design documents and start to think about how the system will be fully
implemented. Your task is to ensure that the program faithfully adheres to the descriptions that you already produced.
When an aspect of the requirements and design documents is not clear, you will need to revisit it and try to resolve any
outstanding concerns. Whenever you make changes to a requirements or design document, you should quickly commit any
changes to your repository so as to best ensure that the requirements and design of the system are in sync with its
implementation. After implementing a portion of your system, please make sure that you demonstrate it to the customer so
as to ensure that it fulfills all of the project requirements.

\section*{Evaluating Your Submission}

The source code for the \mainprogram{} should now contain the correct implementation. Next, all of the source code in
your test suite and your \mainprogram{} should have thoughtful and clear comments. Also, all of your Markdown files
(e.g., the one with a reflection) must meet the standards described in the Markdown Syntax Guide
\url{https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/}. Finally, all of your Markdown files should also adhere to
the Markdown standards established by the \step{Markdown linting} tool available at
\url{https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/}

After the course instructor enables \step{continuous integration} with a system called Travis CI, when you use the
\gitpush{} command to transfer your source code to your GitHub repository, Travis CI will initialize a \step{build} of
your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your source code and writing meet all of
the established requirements, then you will see a green \checkmark{} in the listing of commits in GitHub after awhile.
If your submission does not meet the requirements, a red \naughtmark{} will appear instead. The instructor will reduce a
student's grade for this assignment if the red \naughtmark{} appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the
assignment's due date. Yet, if the green \checkmark{} appears on the last commit in your GitHub repository, then you
satisfied all of the main checks, thereby allowing the course instructor to evaluate other aspects of your source code
and writing, as further described in this assignment sheet. Unless you provide the course instructor with documentation
of the extenuating circumstances that you are facing, no late work will be considered towards your grade for this
laboratory assignment.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

\noindent Students do not need to submit printed source code or technical writing for any assignment in this course.
Instead, this assignment invites you to submit, using GitHub, the following deliverables.

\begin{enumerate}

\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}

\item Stored in \reflection{}, a three-paragraph reflection on the challenges that you faced, the defects in the program
  and/or its specification, and how you performed verification and validation. This Markdown-based document should
  provide sufficient detail to illustrate that you fully understand how the provided requirements and/or implementation
  contain mistakes.

\item Stored in two additional and separate Markdown documents with appropriate names, requirements and design documents
  that clearly explain what the \mainprogramsource{} program should do and how its main components will be organized
  into a cohesive system.

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of \mainprogramsource{} that both meets all of the
  established requirements and produces the desired output.

\item A properly documented, well-formatted, and correct version of \maintestsource{} that both meets all of the
  established requirements and passes correctly.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Evaluation of Your Laboratory Assignment}

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through the commit log in GitHub, you will privately received a grade
on this assignment and feedback on your submitted deliverables. Your grade for the assignment will be a function of the
whether or not it was submitted in a timely fashion and if your program received a green \checkmark{} indicating that it
met all of the requirements. Other factors will also influence your final grade on the assignment. In addition to
studying the efficiency and effectiveness of your Python source code, the instructor will also evaluate the accuracy of
both your technical writing and the comments in your source code. If your submission receives a red \naughtmark{}, the
instructor will reduce your grade for the assignment while still considering the regularity with which you committed to
your GitHub repository and the overall quality of your partially completed work. Please see the instructor if you have
questions about the evaluation of this laboratory assignment.

% \section*{Adhering to the Honor Code}

% In adherence to the Honor Code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate
% for students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish
% carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces
% assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. Deliverables (e.g., Python source code
% or Markdown-based technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work of others will be taken as evidence of
% violating the \mbox{Honor Code}. Please see the course instructor if you have questions about this policy.
